# Basic guides

These guides provide information on how to execute **key functionality** of the ImmutableX platform using our developer tools.

### Each guide provides information for building with:
* [Core SDK](/docs/sdks#core-sdks) - with the [Wallet SDK](/docs/sdks#wallet-sdks) for obtaining user signatures *(recommended)*
* [JS SDK](npmjs.com/package/@imtbl/imx-sdk) - with the [Link SDK](/docs/sdks/#link-sdk) for obtaining user signatures

[**Read more about our SDKs and how they work together >**](./sdks)
