In order to mint tokens from a smart contract on ImmutableX's layer 2, there needs to be a deployed token smart contract on L1 with certain properties. These are:
* Must be a non-fungible token contract (read more [here](../anatomy-smart-contract#token-smart-contracts))
* Must have a `mintFor()` function that allows other contracts to mint on its behalf (see [how to implement this](../anatomy-smart-contract#example-contract))
