# Launch a collection

Launching a collection with ImmutableX means having a [token smart contract](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/tokens) deployed where tokens can be freely transacted (ie. minted, traded, bought and sold) on ImmutableX's layer 2.

:::info Minting tokens on layer 2
If you want to be able to mint tokens on layer 2 from your smart contract, see [these requirements](./launch-collection/smart-contract-requirements).
:::

#### You must do the following:
1. [Register yourself as a user on ImmutableX](./launch-collection/register-as-user)
2. [Register an administrative entity, a project, on ImmutableX](./launch-collection/register-project)
3. [Register the smart contract as a collection on ImmutableX](./launch-collection/register-collection)
4. [Register collection metadata schema](./launch-collection/register-metadata-schema)
