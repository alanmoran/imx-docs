# API changelog

This page is to provide information on:
* [Upcoming breaking changes](#upcoming-breaking-changes)
* [Changelog (breaking and non-breaking changes)](#changelog)


Currently, we use resource versioning (URI-based), i.e. `/v1/<endpoint>`. While we aim to ensure that breaking changes (non-[backwards compatible changes](#backwards-compatible-changes-non-breaking)) are versioned, there are occasions where it is necessary for us to introduce a breaking change to an existing endpoint. This will be communicated to you in advance, and information about this will also be made available on this page.

#### Backwards compatible changes (non-breaking):
* Adding new API resources.
* Adding new optional request parameters to existing API methods.
* Adding new properties to existing API responses.
* Changing the order of properties in existing API responses.
* Changing the length or format of opaque strings, such as object IDs, error messages, and other human-readable strings. This includes adding or removing fixed prefixes.
