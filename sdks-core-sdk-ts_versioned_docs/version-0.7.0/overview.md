# Overview

:::danger The Core TypeScript SDK Interface is under active development and hasn't hit v1.0 yet.

Its public interface shouldn't be considered final, and we may need to release breaking changes as we push towards v1.0.
:::

The Immutable Core SDK provides convenient access to Immutable's APIs and smart contracts to help projects build better web3 games and marketplaces.

Currently, our SDK supports interactions with our application-specific rollup based on StarkWare's StarkEx. In future, we'll be adding StarkNet support across our platform.

## Documentation

See the [developer guides](https://docs.x.immutable.com) for information on building on Immutable X.

See the [API reference documentation](https://docs.x.immutable.com/reference) for more information on our API's.
